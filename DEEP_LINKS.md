# Deep Links (Universal Links) – Respire LYF

This document describes how Universal Links work for `https://app.respirelyf.com`, how the website and iOS app connect, and how attribution is handled.

---

## 1. Supported URLs

**Canonical domain:** `https://app.respirelyf.com`

Marketing and product can use:

- **Path-based:** `https://app.respirelyf.com/paywall`, `https://app.respirelyf.com/youtube`, etc.
- **Single base URL with query:** `https://app.respirelyf.com/?dl_target=dashboard&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social`

Paths are normalized to lowercase on the app; the website redirects capitalized variants to lowercase (e.g. `/YouTube` → `/youtube`) so links work either way.

---

## 2. AASA (Apple App Site Association)

**Source of truth:** The AASA file is served at:

- `https://app.respirelyf.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`

**Important:** The AASA file and path list are **unchanged** by the UTM/attribution work. Do not add new paths for new marketing channels; use query parameters (UTMs and `dl_target`) instead.

**Current paths** (unchanged):

- `/`
- `/paywall`
- `/onboarding`
- `/invite`, `/invite/*`
- `/report/*`, `/insights/*`, `/referr/*`
- `/youtube`, `/instagram`, `/facebook`, `/reddit`, `/x`, `/tiktok`
- `/respire-website`, `/email`

---

## 3. Query parameters

### UTM (attribution)

All standard UTM parameters are supported and passed through; the app parses and stores them for attribution:

- `utm_source`
- `utm_medium`
- `utm_campaign`
- `utm_content`
- `utm_term`

### Destination: `dl_target`

Use `dl_target` to choose the in-app destination without adding new AASA paths:

| Value        | Effect in app                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| `paywall`   | Paywall flow (or login → paywall)      |
| `dashboard` | Dashboard / marketing flow             |
| `onboarding`| Onboarding                             |

Optional future values (not implemented yet): `report:<id>`, `insights:<id>`.

If `dl_target` is missing, the app uses the **URL path** to decide the flow (see routing rules below).

---

## 4. Routing rules (app behavior)

When the user opens a Universal Link and the app launches:

| Condition                         | Destination in app                          |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Path is `/paywall` or `dl_target=paywall` | If logged in → Paywall; else → Login → Paywall |
| Path is `/` or a marketing path, or `dl_target=dashboard` | If logged in → Dashboard; else if first time (onboarding not seen) → Onboarding; else → Login → Dashboard |
| `dl_target=onboarding`           | Onboarding                                  |

**Marketing paths:** `/youtube`, `/instagram`, `/facebook`, `/reddit`, `/x`, `/tiktok`, `/respire-website`, `/email`, `/onboarding`, `/`

---

## 5. Attribution (analytics and storage)

- **Event:** When the app opens via a Universal Link, it logs a Firebase Analytics event `deep_link_opened` with: `url`, `path`, and any present UTM / `dl_target` parameters.
- **First-touch:** Stored once (first time the user ever opens the app via a link). Event `first_touch_attributed` is logged when that happens.
- **Last-touch:** Updated on every Universal Link open.
- **Storage:** First-touch and last-touch are stored **locally only** (UserDefaults). They are **not** sent to the backend in the current implementation.

---

## 6. Future: sending attribution to the backend

When you are ready to send attribution to the backend:

- The iOS app exposes `AttributionStore.currentAttributionForBackend()`, which returns a dictionary with `first_touch` and `last_touch` (each with fields like source, medium, campaign, landing_path, timestamp, etc.).
- Call this at **login success** (or after token refresh) and attach the result to the login (or profile) API payload. No change to AASA or link format is required.

---

## 7. App not installed (fallback on website)

When the user taps a link and the app is **not** installed (or the link opens in Safari):

- The **website** serves a fallback page for supported paths (e.g. `/paywall`, `/youtube`, `/instagram`, …).
- The fallback page shows:
  - Short copy: “Open in Respire LYF App”
  - “Copy link” (same Universal Link, including query string)
  - **“Download on the App Store”** (links to the app by **bundle ID** via `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_STORE_ID`; this is the app, not the website).
- No 404 for these paths; the user can install the app or copy the link to open it from another app (e.g. Notes).

Casing redirects (e.g. `/YouTube` → `/youtube`) are configured in `next.config.js` so that after redirect the fallback page still matches and works.

---

## 8. Examples for marketing

**Open app → dashboard flow (with UTM):**

```
https://app.respirelyf.com/?dl_target=dashboard&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=jan_launch
```

**Open app → paywall flow (path + UTM):**

```
https://app.respirelyf.com/paywall?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=video1
```

**Open app → paywall via single link:**

```
https://app.respirelyf.com/?dl_target=paywall&utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social
```

**Path-based (dashboard flow):**

```
https://app.respirelyf.com/instagram?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social
```

After redirect, `/Instagram?...` becomes `/instagram?...` and the app receives the same path and query.

## 9. Testing deep link analytics (Firebase)

When a user lands in the app via any Universal Link (`https://app.respirelyf.com/...`), the app sends Firebase Analytics events. Use the steps below to confirm they are received.

### Events sent

| Event name | When |
|------------|------|
| `deep_link_opened` | Every time a Universal Link is opened (host `app.respirelyf.com`). |
| `first_touch_attributed` | Only the first time this device/user ever opens the app via a deep link. |

**Parameters** (for both events): `url`, `path`, and when present: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`, `dl_target`.

### Option A: Firebase DebugView (recommended)

1. **Enable debug mode for Firebase Analytics**
   - In Xcode: **Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme…**
   - Select **Run** on the left, open the **Arguments** tab.
   - Under **Arguments Passed On Launch**, add:  
     `-FIRAnalyticsDebugEnabled`
   - Close the dialog and run the app from Xcode.

2. **Stream events in Firebase**
   - In [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com), open your project.
   - Go to **Analytics → DebugView**.
   - Choose your app / device from the dropdown (your device appears after you run the app with the flag above).

3. **Trigger a deep link**
   - On the device/simulator, open a link that goes to `app.respirelyf.com` (e.g. from Notes or Messages):  
     `https://app.respirelyf.com/paywall?utm_source=test`
   - When the app opens, in DebugView you should see:
     - `deep_link_opened` with `url`, `path`, and `utm_source` (and any other params).
     - `first_touch_attributed` with the same params **only** the first time this device opens via a link (clear app data or use a fresh install to see it again).

### Option B: Xcode console

The app logs a single debug line when it sends deep link analytics (using `Logger.printDebug`). In the Xcode console you will see something like:

```
🔵 [env] [DeepLinkAnalytics.logDeepLinkOpened] ----→ Deep link analytics: deep_link_opened url=... path=... firstTouch=true params=[...]
```

- **firstTouch=true** means `first_touch_attributed` was also sent.
- **firstTouch=false** means only `deep_link_opened` was sent.

This confirms the code path ran and what parameters were passed; use DebugView to confirm events actually reach Firebase.

**H1:** FAQs  
**Subtitle:** Frequently Asked Questions about Respire LYF

---

### FAQ 1: What is Respire LYF meant to help me with?

Respire LYF helps you identify patterns and trends in your respiratory symptoms over time by bringing together information from different aspects of your daily life. Viewing these factors together allows Respire LYF to surface correlations that may be difficult to notice when data is considered in isolation.

Respire LYF is designed to support awareness and understanding of your personal data. It does not provide medical advice or replace professional medical decision-making.

---

### FAQ 2: What exactly should I use Respire LYF for — and what should I not use it for?

Use Respire LYF to reflect on symptom trends, explore how changes in daily context relate to those trends, and prepare more informed questions for discussions with your healthcare provider. The app supports an ongoing feedback process focused on observation and understanding, rather than intervention.

Do not use Respire LYF for diagnosis, treatment decisions, medical advice, or emergencies. Always rely on qualified healthcare professionals for medical care.

---

### FAQ 3: What does Respire LYF mean by a "pattern" or "trend"?

A pattern or trend shows repeated associations over time, not a medical conclusion.

These insights are meant to support reflection, not explain causes or predict outcomes.

---

### FAQ 4: Why might Respire LYF show something different from how I feel today?

Respire LYF looks at longer-term trends, while how you feel can change from day to day. Both perspectives are valid and may not always align at a given moment.

In addition to daily inputs, Respire LYF considers historical patterns and notable changes over time, helping place individual days within a broader context. This can highlight when usual patterns are disrupted or when recent experiences differ from longer-term trends, even if those differences are not immediately noticeable.

---

### FAQ 5: Can Respire LYF ever be wrong or limited?

Yes. Insights depend on available data, which may be limited, delayed, or inaccurate.

They should be viewed as supportive information, not definitive answers.

---

### FAQ 6: Should I change anything immediately based on what the app shows?

No. Respire LYF does not recommend changes to treatment, medication, or care plans.

Any health decisions should be made with a qualified healthcare professional.

---

### FAQ 7: What should I do if an insight makes me worried or confused?

Take a pause and avoid jumping to conclusions.

If concerns persist, discuss them with a healthcare professional.

---

### FAQ 8: Can Respire LYF help during an asthma attack or breathing emergency?

No. Respire LYF is not for emergency use.

If you experience severe breathing difficulty or a medical emergency, call local emergency services immediately.

---

### FAQ 9: What if my symptoms suddenly get worse while using the app?

Worsening symptoms should always be taken seriously.

Seek medical care promptly, regardless of what the app shows.

---

### FAQ 10: How does Respire LYF decide what insights to show me?

Respire LYF uses AI to look for patterns and associations in your data.

It does not understand your full medical history or make clinical judgments.

---

### FAQ 11: Does Respire LYF know my full medical history?

No. Respire LYF only uses information you choose to share and supported data sources.

It does not automatically access your medical records.

---

### FAQ 12: Does Respire LYF learn or change over time?

Insights may adapt as more data becomes available.

This does not replace personalized medical care or professional judgment.

---

### FAQ 13: What if I forget to log symptoms or don't use the app every day?

That's completely okay.

Respire LYF is designed to work with real-world, imperfect use.

---

### FAQ 14: What if my wearable or environmental data seems inaccurate?

Wearables and environmental data have limitations.

Use them as context, not facts, and rely on professional advice for decisions.

---

### FAQ 15: Do I need perfect or complete data for Respire LYF to be useful?

No. Respire LYF is designed for everyday use, not precision tracking.

Its role is to support awareness, not require perfection.

---

### FAQ 16: Is Respire LYF a medical device?

No. Respire LYF is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice.

---

### FAQ 17: How should I use Respire LYF alongside my doctor's advice?

Use Respire LYF to notice trends and organize questions.

Medical decisions should always be made with your healthcare provider.

---

### FAQ 18: How do I connect my Apple Watch to Respire LYF?

Follow this step-by-step guide to connect your Apple Watch and install the Respire LYF Watch app. This will enable automatic tracking of your inhaler use and cough detection.

**Step 1: Pair Your Apple Watch**
Hold your Apple Watch near your iPhone and follow the on-screen instructions to pair.

**Step 2: Install Watch App**
Open the Watch app on your iPhone, scroll to 'Available Apps', and tap 'Install' next to Respire LYF Watch.

**Step 3: Open on Both Devices**
Open Respire LYF on both your iPhone and Apple Watch. The watch icon should turn green when connected.

**Step 4: Start Tracking**
On your Apple Watch, tap 'Inhaler Use' or 'Cough Tracker' to begin automatic monitoring.

---

### FAQ 19: What's the difference between "My Plan" and "My Care Plan"?

**"My Plan"**
shows what is due today. It's a daily view that brings together everything you need to do for the current day, based on your schedules and settings.

**"My Care Plan"**
shows how things are scheduled over time. It reflects the routines, schedules, and plans you've set up to repeat across multiple days.

---

### FAQ 20: What does it mean when the app says "Your personalized care plan is ready"?

It means the LYF Hub has personalized the supplement suggestions based on the symptoms and health profile you've shared, using categorization approaches informed by peer-reviewed research on symptom-based wellness support.

This personalization helps surface relevant supplements and is not medical advice or treatment guidance.

---

### Final Reassurance

Respire LYF is here to help you understand your patterns, not to tell you what to do.

You remain in control of your health decisions.

### Understanding Correlations vs. Causation

Respire LYF identifies correlations—patterns where two or more factors appear to be related. It is crucial to understand that:

**Correlation does not equal causation.** Just because two factors appear together does not mean one causes the other. Many factors may be involved, and individual responses vary significantly.

All insights and correlations represent observational findings from user-generated data. They should be discussed with healthcare professionals who can help interpret them in the context of your individual health situation.

### Emergency Situations

**Medical Emergency**

If you experience a medical emergency, severe breathing difficulty, or life-threatening symptoms:

**Call local emergency services immediately (e.g., 911 in the United States)**

Do NOT rely on Respire LYF for emergency medical care. This platform is not designed for emergency situations and cannot provide immediate medical assistance.

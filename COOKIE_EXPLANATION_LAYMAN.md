## Simple Cookie Explanation for Privacy Policy

### What Are Cookies?

Think of cookies as small text files that websites store on your device (computer, phone, or tablet) when you visit them. They help the website remember things about your visit, like your preferences or what pages you've viewed.

**Analogy:** Like a name tag at a conference that helps staff remember who you are and your preferences, cookies help websites remember your visit.

## Why Do We Use Cookies?

We use cookies for two main reasons:

### 1. **To Make the Website Work Properly** (Strictly Necessary)

Some cookies are essential - without them, the website simply won't work correctly. These cookies:
- Remember your preferences (like language settings)
- Keep you logged in (if you have an account)
- Ensure the website loads quickly and securely
- Protect against security threats

**Think of it like:** The foundation of a house - you can't have a house without a foundation, and we can't run the website without these basic cookies.

**Do you need to consent?** **NO** - These cookies are necessary for the website to function, so we don't need your permission to use them. However, you can block them in your browser settings if you choose (though this may break some website features).

### 2. **To Understand How People Use Our Website** (Analytics)

We also use cookies to learn how visitors use our website. This helps us:
- See which pages are most popular
- Understand what features people find useful
- Identify problems or confusing areas
- Improve the website experience for everyone

**Think of it like:** A visitor counter and feedback form at a store - it helps the store owner understand what customers like and how to improve the shopping experience.

**Do you need to consent?** **YES** - These cookies are not essential for the website to work, so we need your permission before we can use them. You can choose to accept or decline these cookies.

## Which Cookies Are Necessary?

- Understand how you navigate the website

**Examples:**

## Do Analytics Cookies Require Consent?

- You can say "Yes, I accept" or "No, I decline"
- If you decline, we won't track your visit for analytics purposes
- The website will work the same either way

**Legal requirement:**
